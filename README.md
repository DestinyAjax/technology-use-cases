## Overview

### Problem Definition

As technologist, what prompts our decision making on what tools, frameworks, libraries or programming language to use all depends on problem definition, business requirement and so many other factors. Different tools are built to solve specific problems or to optimize existing solutions, so the importance of understanding the idea use-cases of a particular technology, tool, framework, library or programming languague cannot be over-emphasised.

### Research

This project is an open-source practical research work that is focused on documenting the idea use-cases of different technologies and also provide code samples where needed.

### Benefits

1. It will help technologists and software developers to make accurate decision when using a technology, whether it's a framework, library, programming language, programming lanaguage feature or concept, tools, etc.
2. It will software developers to build better, efficient and scalable products.
3. It will foster better application of technologies and tools.
